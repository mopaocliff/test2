                                  Project1:

 At work, there are servers that need to be decomissioned ( out of warranty, not working properly, lease expiration)and you are assigned to do a complete inventory of those servers.
please use these components to login to each server in question and do the required task.
The inventory is mostly in case we need to rebuild/order the same server.
